      <Title>Chapter 1 - The Legend Begins</Title>
      <Text>The Dragon Bird jumps out from
the pack! Driving this machine is
Ryu Suzaku, a newcomer from the
High-Mobility Patrol.
Ryu Suzaku had been a detective
in New York 150 years ago and
was enjoying life with his
girlfriend Haruka. But then, while
chasing the feared villain Zoda,
he met with an accident and was
seriously injured. It seemed
impossible to cure him, so he went
into 'cold sleep'.
Then in 2201, Ryu was awakened
by Jody, the leader of the High
Mobility Patrol, and he joined the
group. He didn't know much about
the group, but when he learned
that Zoda had come back to life,
he resolved to join.
'I'll chase you anywhere, Zoda!'
And this is how the legend began.</Text>

      <Title>Chapter 2 - Captain Falcon</Title>
      <Text>Zoda and his cronies had entered
the F-Zero Grand Prix for the
prize money, and Ryu joined the
High-Mobility Patrol in order to
do battle with him. But with
memories of his accident in his
mind, Ryu always lost speed on
curves. This would prevent him
from ever winning an F-Zero
race, and he was dropped from
the racing team.
Ryu was depressed, but got back
into action when saving a shuttle
bus from a space gang. Suddenly
a blue machine containing Captain
Falcon appeared!Falcon helped
Ryu and drove off, promising to
see him at the races. Ryu
entered the race again and
conquered his fears. He was in
the lead until the last moment,
when Captain Falcon snatched
victory from him! Ryu had
disregarded orders and still lost
the race. But his fellow Patrol
member Jack lied and said that he
had removed a screw from Ryu's
machine, preventing him from
winning.</Text>

      <Title>Chapter 3 - Lucy, Patrol Trainee</Title>
      <Text>Ryu and the High Mobility Patrol
have arrived at the circuit on
the planet Cliffot. Jody had
brought along a new trainee,
Lucy. Nervous about the next
day's races, Lucy went on to the
course in Ryu's Dragon Bird to
test the settings.
But Zoda's henchmen saw this and
attacked the Dragon Bird in an
effort to test Ryu's techniques.
Lucy escaped them unhurt, but
the Dragon Bird was damaged.
Lucy felt responsible and took
the machine to Dr. Clash for
repairs. The other members of
the High Mobility Patrol gathered
to help her. Together, they
finished the repairs in time for
the next race. The sturdy
repaired engine helped the
Dragon Bird give Zoda a serious
challenge, and flames burst from
Zoda's machine. Zoda looked out
at Ryu from his flaming car after
150 years, but smoke stood
between them and Zoda
disappeared.
The race ended, and Lucy became
an official member of the High
Mobility Patrol.</Text>

      <Title>Chapter 4 - Samurai Goroh Appears!</Title>
      <Text>An interstellar trailer was
attacked by space pirate Samurai
Goroh, and all its contents were
stolen. Included in the stolen
goods was medicine being sent to
heal critically sick children.
Ryu saw a sick child who dreamed
of overcoming his ailment and
becoming an F-Zero pilot, and
resolved to recover the
medicine.
He headed alone for the planet
Creighton, a planet where
criminals dwelt and where Goroh
was believed to be. Searching for
Goroh, Ryu was surrounded by
hoodlums, but was saved in the
nick of time by master swordsman
Kojiro. Supposedly, Kojiro knew
where Goroh's hideout was.
Together, they headed there and
were attacked by Goroh's
underlings. They defeated them
and reached the interior, where
Goroh was hiding but this Goroh
was a fake! This man had been
using the Samurai Goroh name and
committing evil deeds. Where was
the real Samurai Goroh?
The real one was in fact Kojiro.
Being a thief, he took everything
from the fake and sped off. Ryu
jumped into his machine to give
chase, but in the drivers seat
was the medicine.</Text>

celebrating, the beautiful Lisa
Brilliant appears. Jack, who has
a weakness with women, is fooled
by her charms and his F-Zero
machine, the Astro Robin, is
stolen.
The Patrol sets out to recover
Jack's machine. During a race,
they see a differently-colored
Astro Robin. It seems that Lisa
stole his machine in order to win
the next race. Ryu wants to
somehow get the machine back
from Lisa in the next race, but
his arm injury hasn't healed. He
and Jack ride in the Dragon Bird
together and cooperate to
chase after Lisa. Suddenly the

sees a couple (named 'Truecome'
and 'Dream') in a luxurious car

rescues them and they invite him
to their house in thanks.

house. He had been ordered by
Michael Chain, leader of the
gang, to entrap him. Michael
wanted the elite pilots out of
the race so that he could win the
prize money. Truecome was
obeying him because he wanted to
marry Dream and have an
affluent life with her. But in
fact, Dream didn't need luxury;
she just wanted to be with
Truecome. She convinced
Truecome to set Ryu free.
But then, Michael came to attack
them. Fortunately, Ryu got rid
of him.
Truecome and Dream were able to
marry without the hopes for a
luxurious life. but as it turned
out, Dream was the daughter of
a rich family.</Text>

      <Title>Chapter 8 - The Mysterious Woman, Miss Killer</Title>
      <Text>Ryu defeated Zoda's henchmen
and won another race, his second
in a row. But Ryu's face wasn't
entirely happy he had also been
a racer 150 years in the past,
and then his beloved Haruka was
always with him. Emptiness lay in
Ryu's heart.
That evening, Ryu heard news of
a woman sneaking out of Black
Shadow's base. Chasing after
her, he noticed that she looked
just like Haruka. He caught up
with her and took her to his
house.
But this was an enemy
subterfuge; the woman, Miss
Killer, was one of Black Shadow's
minions. Ryu, who had trusted
her, fell under the curse of The
Skull. Miss Killer pulled out a
knife and attempted to stab Ryu.
At that moment, light from the
neon outside was reflected off a
ring, which had fallen out of a
drawer. This was the ring Ryu had
wanted to give to Haruka.
At that moment, Miss Killer
suddenly froze, and the curse
on Ryu was lifted. Ryu, picking up
the ring, thought, 'Haruka saved
me!'</Text>

      <Title>Chapter 9 - Jody's Secret</Title>
      <Text>An accident by Ryu sent Jody's
car flying out of control. Jody
was supposed to go to the
hospital, but she disappeared.
Ryu was summoned by Dr. Stewart
to the cyborg research facility
managed by the Galactic
Federation. There, Dr. Stewart
informed Ryu that the left side
of Jody's body was in fact made
of metal machinery. Jody's
brother had been killed by Zoda,
and her own body was part
cyborg.
Jody wasn't content just to
hate Zoda. She knew that peace
would never come to the galaxy
until Zoda's evil organization
'Dark Million' was defeated. Ryu
pondered this.
Jody recovered and stumbled
upon one of Zoda's giant
spaceships. But then she was
caught. Ryu found her, and
wanted to give in to his anger
and go after Zoda, but Jody
stopped him.
"You sure showed restraint in
not going after him!"
"No, I was only following your
orders!"</Text>

      <Title>Chapter 10 - Roger and Draq</Title>
      <Text>Ryu and Roger meet a sick boy
named Arias. Arias is afraid to
get an operation, but promises to
undergo it if either Ryu or Roger
can win the next race.
But a sniper is aiming to take out
the cars in the race, Zoda's
henchman, Pico. He's trying to
shoot the cars' chips and cause
an explosion if their speeds
enter the red zone, or go below
orange-4. Ryu and Roger enter
the race anyway, placing
limitations on their speeds. Dark
Million had intimidated Draq, an
associate of Roger, into
cooperating with them in his car,
with its intact chip, he would win
the prize money for the evil
group.
Ryu and Roger, however, want to
keep their promise with Arias.
They ignore the danger and
increase their speed. Somehow,
their cars don't explode, and
they finish first and second
respectively. In fact, Captain
Falcon pretended to retire from
the race, and destroyed the
devices that would have blown up
the two cars.
With this, Arias keeps his end of
the bargain and travels to
another planet to undergo his
operation.</Text>

machines to take pictures with
the kids and sign autographs,
and one boy, under Zoda's
orders, attempts to steal Ryu's
Dragon Bird.
This boy's name is Clank. A
computer hacker, he sneaks into
the Dragon Bird, starts the
machine up, and drives away in it.
Falcon appears mysteriously and
recovers the machine from Clank.
He tells Clank to "go to Mute
City and find something" before
leaving with the machine.
The next day is the day of the
race. Watching Falcon break away
from the pack to win the
competition, Clank decides to
go to Mute City. He sneaks on to
the Dragon Bird again, this time

away by supposed ally Miss Killer.
His machine breaks down, leaving
him upset.
The next race is the "Christmas
Cup", taking place at
shooting-star-barraged Outer
Space: Meteor Stream. Miss Killer
wants to present a victory to
Black Shadow; Zoda is
mysteriously absent. Ryu and
friends also cautiously enter
the race. And as it turns out, a
very unpleasant Christmas
present has been prepared for
them -- Ryu, Captain Falcon, and
Miss Killer are dead even as a
meteor suddenly bombards the
track!
Someone -- Zoda -- has
deactivated the barrier above
the track.
Zoda ignored even the danger to
his ally Miss Killer in his efforts
to attack Ryu and Falcon. But
then the Black Bull appeared in
the race! The enemy-scattering
vehicle protects Miss Killer this
time and explodes... but the
driver is in fact not Black
Shadow, but a a decoy robot. Ryu
and friends gape in astonishment
as the real Black Bull whooshes
past them, cackling as he takes

      <Title>Chapter 13: Honor</Title>
      <Text>Antonio Guster is fed up with the
lax discipline of space pirate
Samurai Goroh.
Guster wants to use explosives,
but Goroh refuses to permit it,
ordering the troublesome Guster
off the ship. Zoda sees this and
takes the opportunity to invite
Antonio to betray Goroh and join
the evil organization Dark Million.
Goroh's minions warn their boss
that Guster may turn on him, but
Goroh is adamant in his trust for
his subordinate.
When the race begins, Ryu and
Goroh are in the lead, and
Guster is indeed betraying Goroh:
he's added land mines to the
course! Goroh doesn't get
trapped in the explosions,
however, slowly leading his
machine through the smoke.
Goroh brandishes his sword at
the traitorous Guster, but lets
him escape without swinging the
weapon. Guster laughs at
Goroh's weakness. Ryu, watching
this, is relieved as he realizes
that Goroh hasn't done anything
immoral.</Text>

      <Title>Chapter 14: Iron Man Neelsen</Title>
      <Text>Jack is upset over not being able
to defeat Ryu in a race, and he
meets with the "ironman" Silver
Neelsen, still going strong at
the age of 97. Neelsen tells him,
"I know why you can't win those
races!" and takes him on for
special training.
Seventy years ago, Neelsen had
a rival that he just couldn't
beat, named Anthony. And on the
day when they were to duel,
Neelsen chickened out and didn't
show up for the race. Now, 70
years later, Neelsen meets
Anthony again. He had figured
Anthony was already dead, but in
fact Anthony had been in "cold
sleep" and was just the same as
years ago. Neelsen challenges
him to a race to fulfill the
promise made 70 years ago. Jack,
learning from Neelsen about why
he couldn't win, also joins the
race.
The rivals begin their battle, and
at the end, Ryu, Jack, Neelsen,
and Anthony are neck-and-neck
for the lead. Jack pulls ahead
to win, Ryu finishes second, and
Neelsen and Anthony tie for
third. Ryu shouts
congratulations at Jack, who
embarrassedly thanks his rival,
saying, "I won it because you
were here!"</Text>

      <Text>With police checks becoming
strict, Zoda is unable to ship his
stolen goods from Mute City. He
calls on the hitman Pico to
eliminate Galactic Police chief
John Tanaka.
Tanaka, having no idea that he's
been targeted, is on his way to a
dinner show starring his favorite
singer, Kate Alen. This is where
Pico attacks him.
John Tanaka manages to escape
from Pico, but Jody Summer finds
out that his life was in danger,
and places him in a Galactic Police
building for his safety. John,
wanting to see Kate's show,
distracts the guards and
escapes.
On the large passenger ship
where the show is taking place,
however, Zoda is attempting to
steal valuable goods from the
ship's holds. John is unaware of
this and is simply looking forward
to the show, but Zoda thinks
that John's presence on the ship
means that his plan has been
discovered.
Zoda takes John to the hold in
order to dispose of him. Here he
is spotted by Ryu andhis friends,
who are on board looking for
Tanaka.
Ryu and comrades rescue Tanaka
and recover the stolen goods.

      <Text>Miss Killer approaches Super
Arrow, self-styled defender of
justice, in order to make use of
him. The naive Super Arrow is
completely taken in by her lies,
pledging to help her win her
race. Ryu sees this and warns
Super Arrow that Miss Killer is in
fact an agent of Dark Million,
but Super Arrow refuses to
listen.
Training Miss Killer for victory,
Super Arrow teaches her the
"sandwich burst" technique. He
also gets Ryu to help her.
Race day: Miss Killer uses the
"sandwich burst" technique to
put her Moon Shadow in first
place. But then Mrs. Arros,
Super Arrow's wife, uses the
same move to put Ryu's car in

prevent Miss Killer from winning.
Later, Super Arrow looks into

      <Title>Chapter 17: Ryu's Excellent Day Off</Title>
      <Text>Having repeatedly endured togh
races, the Dragon Bird has
sustained serious damage. Ryu
decides to take some time off
while maintenance is
performed on the car.
At a scrap yard, Ryu finds his
own car that he drove 150 years
ago, and decides to spend his
vacation repairing it with Clank.
They finish the repairs and go
for a drive around Mute City.
But then Ryu's car gets a flat
tire, thanks to Octoman.
They go to a parts shop to get a
new tire, and the saleswoman
recommends installing a camera
to prevent theft, so they add
that to the car.
The saleswoman, however, was in
fact... Miss Killer!
She was planning to use the
anti-theft camera to spy on
them and steal Ryu's driving
techniques. Ryu finds Octoman
and chases him in his beloved
150-year-old car. 
Ryu and Clank realize that
Miss Killer is spying on their
car chase.  Clank figures
out where the images are being
sent, and when they go there,
Miss Killer is waiting for them
with a smile.
"I've got all the data I need,"

ske asks what Clank is doing
there, the nefarious Zoda
appears.  Before getting an
answer, Jody pulls Clank to
safety.
What Zoda is after is a computer
virus in Clank's possession.  A
year ago, Zoda had ordered a
computer virus from the hacker
Clank, and Clank sent it

never reached Zoda because of
the accident.
Clank wants to wash himself of
those evil deeds and had come to

      <Title>Chapter 21: An Intense Women's Battle!</Title>
      <Text>Once a year, an F-ZERO race is
held for women only.
The winner is crowned
"Miss Galactic Federation".

The pilots and staff are all
female, with no men allowed.
But mysteriously, female pilots
like Kate Alen, Lisa Brilliant, and
Mrs. Arrow have disappeared. 
Dr. Stewart, Clash, and the rest
of the High Mobility Team, 
needing to get to the race
course, dress Ryu and Jack up
as women and set themselves up 
as their bodyguards.

The villain behind the
disappearances was Miss Killer,
who wanted to kidnap rival pilots
so that she could win the race.
She threatens Lucy with a knife
and tells her to make sure
Jody doesn't enter the race. 

With Jody out, Miss Killer would
be the favorite to win.
But the woman-guised Ryu and
Jack are there to save Lucy.

Miss Killer's plan fails -- the
other female pilots having been
saved, the race begins without
incident. But it doesn't end that
way.  Some of the pilots have
ignored the rules and equipped
their machines with weapons,
causing a brawl. The confusion
causes the race to be cancelled.
Watching this, the male pilots can
only sigh heavily, saying, "Sure is
scary when women fight each
other..."</Text>

      <Title>Chapter 22: Ryu and Falcon</Title>
      <Text>Ryu was upset that he was still
thought of as a 'person from
the past'.  He realized that he
had no idea who had created the
ending to his Dargon Bird, and
thought, 'just like me'.

Jody was working on repairing a
warp gate. In order to keep Ryu
and her friends out of danger,
she hadn't invited them along.
But then she got sucked into the
hole and warped to the planet
where Zoda's base was!
Now Zoda's cronies were after
her; she was in a pinch.

To save Jody, Ryu and the rest
of the team had to repair the
gate. But despite giving
everything they could, they
couldn't fix the problem. Just
as they fell into the depths of
despair, Captain Falcon
appeared.  He told Ryu just
where to drive his machine, and at
that point his car was bathed in
light as a mysterious power
repaired the warp gate.  They
were able to get Jody back
without trouble.

What exactly was the secret of
the Dragon Bird?  Its mystery
only deepened.</Text>
